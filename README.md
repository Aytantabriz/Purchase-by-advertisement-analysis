# Purchase-by-advertisement-analysis
Binary classification modelling

## About the project
Classification task is about to determine purchase based on *gender, age* and *salary* features. During the project, we need to determine whether the person that saw advertisement will buy product or not.
Tested classification models include **Logistics regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision tree** and **Random forest**. 
We are going to apply all algorithms and select best fit model based accuracy metrics.

## Model Accuracy
Best fit model identified as Kernel SVM algorithm which deals with **non-linearity and higher dimensions**.

| model_name | accuracy    |
| :---:   | :---: |
 logistic   |  0.82
KNN     |0.88
SVM    | 0.80
kernel_SVM   |  0.89
naive_bayes   |  0.87
decision_tree  |   0.83
random_forest  |   0.88
